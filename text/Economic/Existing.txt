The impact of urban morphology and the architecture on pedestrian wind comfort has been studied. Wind simulations were conducted using SimScale and STAR-CCM+ in different directions. Comparisons were particularly done using two wind directions to compare the effect of urban morphology evolution, building design, and  level of detail in modeling  on pedestrian wind comfort. The results could be further explored in this section
