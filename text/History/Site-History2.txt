There are some historical architectural drawings of the building showing plan, elevetaion, and section drawings. The drawings of the builing were made in august 1924. The drawing has a text description as follows “survey of a building for residential use located in massawa island lot no. 12 of the P.R. on behalf of Mr Said Mohamed Bazaham”. This seem to have been used as an inventory of the city buildings with block numbering system. This numbering system is different to the reference number in this building passport. It is thus important to notice this differences when relating buildings in different inventories.

Despite having the indication of the historic architectural drawings, it is difficult to certainly tell when the building was built. The timeline when the drawing was made suggests that it was around the reconstruction of the buildings damaged from the 1921 Massawa earthquake. Despite this information, it is difficult to tell if the drawing was made before the construction of the heritage buildings or as-built after the completion. There also exoistst some differences between the current state of the building and the drawing. Further studies are thus required on the history of the building.
